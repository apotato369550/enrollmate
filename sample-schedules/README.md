- Generate schedules - should get morning-only options!

### Scenario 2: Avoid Full Sections (Engineering)
- Import `engineering/engineering-student-schedule.csv`
- Uncheck "Allow full sections"
- Generate schedules - should exclude sections showing 40/40, 35/35, etc.

### Scenario 3: Night Owl (Finance)
- Import `finance/finance-student-schedule.csv`
- Set constraints: Earliest Start = 12:00, Latest End = 18:00
- Generate schedules - should prefer afternoon/evening sections

### Scenario 4: Balanced Schedule (Psychology)

## üîß Customization Tips

Want to create your own archetype?

1. Copy any existing CSV file
2. Modify the course codes, names, and schedules
3. Keep the same CSV format
4. Save with a descriptive name
5. Import into Enrollmate!

**Tips:**
- Use realistic enrollment numbers (most sections shouldn't be 100% full)
- Vary section times to create more scheduling options
- Include at-risk sections (low enrollment) to test filtering
- Mix MW and TTh schedules for flexibility

---

## üìù Notes

- Each archetype includes **6 core courses** with **3 sections each** (18 total sections)
- Enrollment numbers are realistic based on typical class sizes for each major
- Time slots avoid early morning (before 8 AM) and late evening (after 6:30 PM)
- Some sections are intentionally full or at-risk to test constraint filtering
- All schedules follow standard academic patterns (MW, TTh, or full-week)

---

## üöÄ Happy Scheduling!

These samples are designed to help you:
- Test the scheduler engine thoroughly
- Demonstrate the app to stakeholders
- Understand how different majors have different scheduling needs
- Experiment with various constraints and preferences

**Pro Tip:** Try importing multiple archetypes and mixing courses from different majors to simulate a student with diverse interests or double majors!
